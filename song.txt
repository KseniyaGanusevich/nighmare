The thoughts inside my head
I think it's time to let them out
No question on which way to go
It doesn't matter now
I take a step, whichever destination
I'll be runnin'
Tighten up my laces
'Cause I'm ready to be movin'
 
Now I'm free, get up
I know that I can go anywhere
Free, get up
You be surprised I'll be everywhere
Free, get out
Anywhere now I don't even care
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
